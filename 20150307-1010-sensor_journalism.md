## Cicada tracker ##

Every 17 years, this brood of cicadas comes out of the ground--not breaking
news by any means. In 2013, WNYC reported on how you can predict their
emergence by the date the soil at a certain depth reaches a certain
temperature--so they distributed a tutorial to build Arduino-based temperature
sensors.

**800** locations got measured and reported back to the WNYC website, with a
total of 4,500 cicada sighting reports.

Led to a lot of coverage, including a sensor journalism conference at Columbia
University and a session at ONA!

John's message back then: "This isn't really journalism, but you guys should
really do this!" (His justification: This is more of a cool feature story.)

## Sleep tracker ##

John built a sensor in 2014 and strapped it to his arm to see whether he could
measure the quality of his sleep for a feature story about sleep.

They didn't distribute plans for this, but they still engaged with users to
track their sleep for a couple of months as part of that same feature story.

The tracking used a custom "sleep journal" built as a Web app and an iOS app.

**5,200** people submitted sleep records--a total of 63,700 records.

One-third of users submitted via the iOS application.

"Important discovery: Making apps is really hard. I do not recommend it."

## Bored and Brilliant ##

Someone asked John: "You can build apps, right? Can you build an app to track
how much people use their phones?"

Given the previous discovery, he answered "no", but apps already exist for the
major platforms to track this kind of thing--can we reach out to the companies
that publish these applications?

Moment app for iPhone added an opt-in feature to let users submit usage data to
WNYC!

"This is actually a sensor project...it's sensing whether your phone screen is
on."
