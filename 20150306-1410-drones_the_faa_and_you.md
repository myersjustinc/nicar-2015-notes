# Drones, the FAA and you #

**Speaker:** Matt Waite, University of Nebraska-Lincoln

## The rules right now ##

All drone flights are banned in the United States right now for any purpose
other than hobbyist stuff.

* **Hobbyists:** Don't be stupid.

* **Government users:** Need a permit.

* **Commercial users:** Anyone doing stuff for compensation--can't do anything
  right now.

  "Commercial" is defined extremely broadly. If anything of value is exchanged
  for anything even remotely related to the flight, it's commercial, regardless
  of the user's other operations.

## There's hope! ##

* The FAA has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
* The first step is a public comment period that's open until April 24.
* If you or your news organization wants to use drones, you should comment.

### What's in the NPRM? ###

* No pilot's license required. But you have to pass a test to be certified.

* Will allow for flying in restricted airspace with approval from air traffic
  control.

* You cannot fly beyond your line of sight.

* You cannot fly at night.

* You cannot fly directly over people outside your control.
