**Speakers:** Abe Handler, The Lens; Thomas Thoren, The Lens; Todd Wallack, The
Boston Globe

**Slides:** <http://bit.ly/RedAlertNICARSlides> <http://bit.ly/1AMotr6>

## Existing tools ##

* **Google Alerts:** Email updates about new results for search queries you run
  often

* **RSS feeds:** Updated lists of new content (e.g., press releases, articles)

  * Regulatory agencies often post things here first, and if you're paying
    attention, you can scoop pretty easily.

  * Use a reader application such as Feedly, The Old Reader or Blogtrottr.

* **IFTTT (If This, Then That):** Create "recipes" using common websites and
  apps, but without any actual programming needed

  * For example, **if** a new item is added to the Louisiana legislature RSS
    feed, **then** send it to me as an email.

  * Or **if** someone tweets near City Hall, **then** add it to this Google
    spreadsheet.

* **Page monitoring:** Track updates to sites without RSS feeds

  * Page Monitor is an example Chrome extension that does this.

* **Socrata:** Common data portal for governments such as New Orleans and
  Baltimore, which also provides RSS feeds of new data sets

* **Email lists:** Common way to distribute news alerts.

* **Twitter:** Increasingly common way to distribute news alerts.
