# Bridging the Developer/Journalist Gap #

What do we have in common? **Winning is good:** We all care about doing good in the public realm and
effecting change.

That said, there are gaps:

* How do we get developers engaged in the process of journalism?

  * Newsroom developers should keep product developers in the loop.

* How do we encourage editors and reporters to include developers in
  journalistic discussions?

  * Developers should speak up and suggest stories and contribute to newsroom
    discussions, rather than just saying no to things.

  * "Create a presence for yourself in the newsroom," DeBarros tells
    developers.

* How do we manage expectations around timelines?

  * Journalists are used to unyielding publication deadlines; developers are
    used to processes that take longer and can be unpredictable.

  * Development timelines don't transfer that well, either; just because one
    project was quick doesn't mean the next one will be.

* How do journalists understand how developers set priorities?

  * Overexplain sometimes--developers can take things for granted because
    they're in that world every day, and not everyone is aware of the things
    they have to take into account.

  * Developers shouldn't make as many commitments as early in the process,
    because it can make them seem fickle or arbitrary if they have to backtrack
    on those commitments later in the process.
