# Bridging the Developer/Journalist Gap #

**Speakers:** Anthony DeBarros, DocumentCloud; Maureen Linke, Associated Press;

What do we have in common? **Winning is good:** We all care about doing good in the public realm and
effecting change.

That said, there are gaps:

* How do we get developers engaged in the process of journalism?

  * Newsroom developers should keep product developers in the loop.

* How do we encourage editors and reporters to include developers in
  journalistic discussions?

  * Developers should speak up and suggest stories and contribute to newsroom
    discussions, rather than just saying no to things.

* How do we manage expectations around timelines?

  * Journalists are used to unyielding publication deadlines; developers are
    used to processes that take longer and can be unpredictable.

  * Development timelines don't transfer that well, either; just because one
    project was quick doesn't mean the next one will be.
