# Make Photoshop work for you #

**Speaker:** Chris Canipe, The Wall Street Journal

Example folder is [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByZb_bUVlqwjdkgzSnRGRk40Sm8/view).

## Simple actions ##

Record actions as you do them, and then replay those actions for a folder full
of images if you want.

Open the Actions palette (Window -> Actions), which already includes a lot of
common tasks by default.

Click the "Create New Action" icon in the bottom (looks like your usual
folded-corner "New" icon) and give your new action a name.

You'll notice a red record icon shows up becomes active once you're done with
that dialog.

Perform your actions in whatever order makes the most sense (needs a bit of
trial and error sometimes).

Press the stop (square) button next to the red record icon.

**Tip:** Don't record opening, saving or closing of files; you can handle this
elsewhere.
