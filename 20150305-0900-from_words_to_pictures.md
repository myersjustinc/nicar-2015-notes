# From Words to Pictures: Text Analysis and Visualization #

**Speaker**: Nicholas Diakopoulos, University of Maryland

## What's different about text? ##

Text is a sequence of written or spoken words, but it can be analyzed
in other forms:

* Frequencies/rates
* Context
* Semantics

This differs from other kinds of data structures:

* Tables
* Geometries (2D or 3D)
* Networks (graphs)
* Trees (hierarchies)
* Time series

Examples include [presidential pronouns](http://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/obamas-pronouns-dont-make-him-narcissist)
and the [State of the Union semantics](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/2014-state-of-the-union/language-of-sotu/).
